# Shrimpy Trading AI Status
This page provides live status reporting for the cloud based trading AI that manages my Shrimpy leader profiles. The system constantly monitors exchange data and looks for opportunities to buy and sell crypto assets at profit. I do not want the system to be a black box, and followers can use the data below to understand the upcoming trade targets.

The Shrimpy portfolio API is used to execute the AI generated trades, allowing them to be followed and reproduced by community members.
