# Shrimpy Trading AI Status
This page provides live status reporting for the cloud based trading AI that manages my Shrimpy leader profiles. The system constantly monitors exchange data and looks for opportunities to buy and sell crypto assets at profit. I do not want the system to be a black box, and followers can use the data below to understand the upcoming trade targets.

The Shrimpy portfolio API is used to execute the AI generated trades, allowing them to be followed and reproduced by community members. General status of the Shrimpy API and the trading AI are below.

### ![Kraken](https://assets.shrimpy.io/exchanges/kraken.png) HODLME
Kraken is home to my original [HODLME](https://dashboard.shrimpy.io/leader/hodlme) leader profile. This profile will *always* be free to follow. It has the largest number of users and longest performance history. The buy/sell percentages represent the AI-determined portfolio movement required to initiate trading activity.

### ![Coinbase Pro](https://assets.shrimpy.io/exchanges/coinbasepro.png) GOALASKA
The [GOALASKA](https://dashboard.shrimpy.io/leader/goalaska) leader profile was launched on the Coinbase Pro exchange as my first *premium* portfolio, with a modest rate of 0.5% follower assets under management. The buy/sell percentages represent the AI-determined portfolio movement required to initiate trading activity.

### ![Binance.US](https://assets.shrimpy.io/exchanges/binanceus.png) HODLBUS
Based on user feedback to widen my presence on other exchanges, I most recently started the [HODLBUS](https://dashboard.shrimpy.io/leader/hodlbus) leader profile on Binance US. I used the same 0.5% assets under management rate as Coinbase Pro, since this configuration seemed reasonable to my followers. The buy/sell percentages represent the AI-determined portfolio movement required to initiate trading activity.
